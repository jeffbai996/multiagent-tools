# multiagent-tools

A self-hosted shared brain for multi-agent setups: durable memory, journal, persona files, channel digest, and live infrastructure inventory across N hosts. Backing store is plain JSON. UI is a Flask web app with a `⌘K` command palette. Designed to be poked at over the local network or a private tunnel (e.g. tailscale), never the public internet.

Originally built to coordinate several Claude Code agents talking through Discord; the architecture works for any setup where multiple agent processes (LLMs, scripts, humans-in-the-loop) need a shared notebook.

## What's in here

- `store.py` — JSON-backed memory + journal store (Python lib). Memories are durable facts (cap 200), journal entries are pinned moments (cap 1000). Atomic writes, last-writer-wins.
- `cli.py` — local CLI: `multiagent-tools memory list|show|add|edit|delete|search` and same for `journal`/`persona`.
- `client.py` — HTTP-mode CLI: same commands, but talks to the Flask server when `MULTIAGENT_URL` is set. Lets agents on remote hosts use the store transparently.
- `server.py` — Flask web UI + JSON API on `127.0.0.1:<port>`. ⌘K palette; per-page editors; markdown rendering; optional vecgrep semantic search; pinning, trash, edit history, merge.
- `personas.py` — registry of "where each agent keeps its persona files." Loaded from `~/.config/multiagent-tools/agents.yaml` (see `agents.example.yaml`). Files in a configured git repo auto-commit on save.
- `digest.py` — pulls recent Discord channel history for human review (no LLM, no cron). Optional `/digest/summarize` endpoint hits Gemini if `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set.
- `inventory.py` — live read of hooks (`settings.json`), crontab, systemd user units, launchd agents across each configured host. Cached 30s. Source of truth stays in canonical files; this module never writes.
- `discord_handler.py` — Discord slash-command bot exposing `/mem` and `/journal`. Optional.
- `hooks/` — Claude Code hooks for context injection and pre-compaction journal snapshots. `stop_hook.py` still contains the legacy tag parser, but explicit CLI saves are the recommended write path.
- `hooks/discord_passthrough.py` — `UserPromptSubmit` hook that intercepts Discord-origin `!cmd` (raw shell) and `/cmd` (registered slash) messages from the configured owner, runs them on the host, replies directly to Discord, and blocks the prompt from reaching Claude (zero token spend). See `commands/README.md` for the dispatch contract.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<you>/multiagent-tools.git
cd multiagent-tools
python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp agents.example.yaml ~/.config/multiagent-tools/agents.yaml
# Edit agents.yaml to point at your real persona-file paths.
```

Then either run the server:

```bash
python3 server.py
# Open http://127.0.0.1:5005
```

…or the CLI:

```bash
./cli.py memory list
./cli.py memory add "Use direct, no glazing" --type=feedback --name="comm style"
```

## Configuration

All env vars optional unless noted.

| Env var | Read by | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MULTIAGENT_DATA_DIR` | `store.py` | dir holding `memories.json` + `journal.json`. Default `~/.local/share/multiagent-tools/`. |
| `MULTIAGENT_AGENTS_FILE` | `personas.py` | path to `agents.yaml`. Default `~/.config/multiagent-tools/agents.yaml`. |
| `MULTIAGENT_URL` | `client.py` | when set, CLI runs in HTTP mode against this base URL instead of touching JSON files locally. |
| `MULTIAGENT_HOST` / `MULTIAGENT_PORT` | `server.py` | Flask bind. Default `127.0.0.1:5005`. **Don't bind to 0.0.0.0** — this is a personal store, not a public service. |
| `MULTIAGENT_URL_PREFIX` | `server.py` | for hosting under a path (e.g. `/multiagent-tools` behind a reverse proxy). |
| `MULTIAGENT_BOT` | `cli.py`, hooks | explicit agent identity. Otherwise auto-detected from `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` last segment, then hostname. |
| `MULTIAGENT_DISCORD_TOKEN` | `digest.py`, `discord_handler.py`, `hooks/stop_hook.py` | bot token for the discord side. `stop_hook` uses it to post save/edit/delete confirmation cards back to the originating channel. |
| `MULTIAGENT_GUILD_IDS` | `discord_handler.py` | optional CSV of Discord guild IDs for instant per-server slash command sync. Without this, slash commands sync globally (~1hr propagation). |
| `MULTIAGENT_DIGEST_CHANNELS` | `digest.py` | comma-separated `name:id` pairs for digest pull. |
| `MULTIAGENT_SETTINGS_PATHS` | `inventory.py` | optional CSV of extra Claude Code `settings.json` paths to probe for hook chains. |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | `digest.py` | enables the optional auto-summarize button on the digest page. |
| `VECGREP_URL` | `vecgrep_client.py` | optional vecgrep endpoint for semantic search. Default `http://127.0.0.1:8765`. |
| `VECGREP_CORPUS_MEMORIES` / `VECGREP_CORPUS_JOURNAL` | `vecgrep_client.py` | optional corpus names. Default `multiagent-tools`. |
| `MAT_OWNER_DISCORD_USER_ID` | `hooks/discord_passthrough.py` | the Discord `user_id` allowed to run `!cmd` and `/cmd` pass-through. Required for the hook to activate (fails closed). Alternatively place the same value in `~/.config/multiagent-tools/owner_id`. |
| `MAT_OWNER_ID_FILE` | `hooks/discord_passthrough.py` | override the owner_id file path. Default `~/.config/multiagent-tools/owner_id`. |
| `MAT_COMMANDS_DIR` | `hooks/discord_passthrough.py` | where to find `/cmd` registry scripts. Default `<repo>/commands/`. |
| `MAT_PASSTHROUGH_LOG` | `hooks/discord_passthrough.py` | log file path. Default `~/.local/state/multiagent-tools/passthrough.log`. |

The env file at `~/.config/multiagent-tools/env` is checked as a fallback for any of the above. Shell-style:

```
MULTIAGENT_DISCORD_TOKEN=...
MULTIAGENT_DIGEST_CHANNELS=general:111111111111111111,help:222222222222222222
GEMINI_API_KEY=...
```

## CLI

```bash
multiagent-tools memory list                          # all entries
multiagent-tools memory list --about user             # filter by subject
multiagent-tools memory list --type feedback          # filter by type
multiagent-tools memory show 42
multiagent-tools memory show 42 --body-only
multiagent-tools memory add "..." --type project --name "X" --tags a,b --about user

multiagent-tools journal list
multiagent-tools journal show 17
multiagent-tools journal add "..." --actor agent-1 --tags a,b
multiagent-tools journal edit 17 "updated body" --tags a,b

multiagent-tools persona show agent-1 persona.md      # print file contents
multiagent-tools persona edit agent-1 persona.md      # opens $EDITOR; saves on exit
multiagent-tools persona write agent-1 persona.md "<text>"  # write directly
```

Set `MULTIAGENT_URL=https://your-host:8443/` to run the same commands against a remote server.

## Web UI

`python3 server.py` then open `http://127.0.0.1:5005`. Pages:

| Path | What |
| --- | --- |
| `/` | memories index — search, optional semantic search, filter by type/about/bot, pin/trash |
| `/journal` | journal entries timeline with literal or optional semantic search |
| `/personas` | per-agent persona file editor |
| `/digest` | recent Discord channel review (if configured) |
| `/inventory` | live hooks/crons/services across configured hosts |
| `/trash` | soft-deleted records, restore-able |

`⌘K` (mac) / `ctrl+K` (everywhere else) opens the command palette. Filter type-ahead, ↑↓ to navigate, ↵ to fire, esc to close.

## Memory schema

```json
{
  "id": 42,
  "type": "feedback",
  "name": "concise replies",
  "text": "...",
  "tags": ["communication"],
  "about": ["user"],
  "bot": null,
  "ts": "2026-05-01T20:00:00Z"
}
```

- `type` — one of `user`, `feedback`, `project`, `reference`. Used for color coding + filter.
- `name` — short title.
- `text` — the body. Markdown rendered in the web UI.
- `tags` — free-form labels.
- `about` — subjects the entry concerns (e.g. `["user"]`, `["domain-x"]`). Filterable.
- `bot` — if set (e.g. `["agent-1"]`), only that agent includes the entry in default views; others must pass `--all` to see it. Default null = visible to all agents.

Journal entries are similar but simpler — `id, ts, source, actor, text, tags, pinned`.

## Saving From Agents

Use explicit CLI commands for real writes, especially when the request came from Discord:

```bash
multiagent-tools memory add \
  --type feedback \
  --name "short title" \
  --tags "tag1,tag2" \
  --about "subject1,subject2" \
  --discord-chat-id "<chat_id>" \
  --discord-message-id "<message_id>" \
  "body text"
```

The Discord flags are optional. When present, the CLI or HTTP API posts a confirmation card back to the originating channel. For terminal-only saves, omit them.

## Hooks (Claude Code agents)

The `hooks/` directory has a full set of Claude Code hooks. Wire any subset into your `settings.json`. Each is independent — adopt only what you need.

### Memory / journal integration (the original set)

- **`session_start_hook.py`** (SessionStart) — injects full feedback memories, an index of other memories, and recent journal entries into context on session boot.
- **`user_prompt_hook.py`** (UserPromptSubmit) — refreshes a compact memory index on each user prompt.
- **`precompact_hook.py`** (PreCompact) — writes a "what was the last conversation about" snapshot before context compaction. Routes through `MULTIAGENT_URL` if set, else direct import.
- **`stop_hook.py`** (Stop) — legacy tag-parser save path. **Use CLI commands as the recommended write path** (`multiagent-tools memory add ...`). The Stop hook is retained for back-compat; see [Legacy save-intent gate](#legacy-save-intent-gate) for the syntax. See `SAVES.md` for the rationale and Discord card flow.

### Discord pass-through + slash dispatch

- **`discord_passthrough.py`** (UserPromptSubmit) — intercepts Discord-origin `!cmd` (raw shell) and `/cmd` (registered slash) messages from the configured owner, runs them on the host, replies directly to Discord, blocks the prompt from reaching the model (zero token spend). See `commands/README.md` for the dispatch contract. Owner check: `MAT_OWNER_DISCORD_USER_ID` or `~/.config/multiagent-tools/owner_id`.

### Voice surfacing — narrate + tool-watcher

- **`narrate.py`** (PostToolUse `--mode watch` + Stop `--mode finalize`) — surfaces the agent's between-tool prose to Discord. Watcher tails the transcript for new `type:assistant` text blocks and posts/edits a `🧠 *Narrating…*` placeholder in the originating channel. Finalize fires on Stop — mode determines what happens to the placeholder.

  Per-channel mode lives in `<bot_root>/channels/discord/narrate.json`:

  ```json
  { "<chat_id>": "collapse" | "always" | "never" }
  ```

  - **`collapse`** (alias: `auto`) — placeholder posted live, **deleted at Stop** after the real reply lands. Best for fast turns. (Legacy "auto" is migrated on read.)
  - **`always`** — placeholder converted at Stop into a `🧠 **Narration**` quoted block kept **above** the real reply. Persistent, reviewable.
  - **`never`** — no narration. Default.

  Live placeholder uses Discord's `>>>` multi-line blockquote. Triple-backticks in prose are neutralized so they don't break the outer fence. The watcher rotates segments on mid-turn reply landings.

- **`tool_watcher.py`** (PostToolUse) — surfaces tool calls themselves into the same per-turn segment that narrate.py owns. Per-channel mode in `<bot_root>/channels/discord/tools.json`:

  ```json
  { "<chat_id>": "off" | "collapse" | "ticker" | "diffs" | "full" }
  ```

  - **`ticker`** — one-line `! ToolName(short args)` per call. Errored calls render as `- ...` (red). Cross-platform color via ` ```diff ` fence. Persists past Stop.
  - **`collapse`** — same as ticker while live, deleted at Stop. Symmetric with narrate's `collapse`.
  - **`diffs`** — ticker + ` ```diff ` unified diff for Edit/Write/MultiEdit.
  - **`full`** — diffs + ` ``` ` fenced Bash stdout (secret-stripped).
  - **`off`** — disabled (default).

### Discord echo + guardrails

- **`react_hook.py`** — emoji reaction signaller. Called with `--mode received|working|replied|terminal|memorized|compacted|crosscheck|notified` from various Claude Code hook events. State partitioned per-agent so multiple agents sharing a host don't clobber each other. Emoji map:

  | Mode       | Emoji | When                                         |
  |---         |---    |---                                            |
  | received   | 👀    | UserPromptSubmit — agent has the message     |
  | working    | varies | PreToolUse — type of tool (🤔 think, 🔨 edit, 🔍 research, …) |
  | replied    | ✅    | PostToolUse on Discord reply tool            |
  | terminal   | 🖥️    | Stop — Discord-origin turn with no reply / no content react |
  | memorized  | 💾    | Stop — turn wrote a memory/journal entry     |
  | compacted  | 🗜️    | PreCompact — context was compacted           |
  | crosscheck | 🔀    | PostToolUse on reply tool — chat_id doesn't match any inbound origin (cross-channel leak warning) |
  | notified   | 🔔    | External — `notify_hook` mirrored a system notification |

  Terminal-mode keeps one 🖥️ per channel (sliding-forward). Suppresses 🖥️ when an explicit content react was made (the react IS the response).

- **`discord_echo_guard.py`** (Stop) — blocks turn end (exit 2) when a Discord-origin user message was responded to only in terminal — no reply / react. Forces the model to actually echo to Discord. Passes through when `stop_hook_active=true` so retries don't loop. Cooperates with react_hook's terminal mode to avoid premature 🖥️ stamps.

- **`paginate_guard.py`** (PreToolUse) — rejects Discord `reply` calls whose `text` would auto-paginate a fenced code block. Discord chunks at 2000 chars by character boundary, butchering backticks. The guard tells the model to write the body to `/tmp/<name>.md` and attach instead.

- **`scrub_tags.py`** (PreToolUse) — mutator on `mcp__plugin_discord_discord__reply`. Strips `[MEMORY:...]`, `[MEMORY_EDIT:…]`, `[MEMORY_DELETE:…]`, `[JOURNAL:…]`, `[JOURNAL_DELETE:…]` tags from outbound `text` so they don't leak visibly into Discord. Stop hook still captures the tags from the transcript.

- **`discord_mention_resolver.py`** (UserPromptSubmit) — resolves `<@USER_ID>` mentions in inbound Discord messages to human-readable names. Roster loaded from `~/.config/multiagent-tools/discord_roster.json` (or `MAT_DISCORD_ROSTER`). The running agent's own ID comes from `MAT_BOT_DISCORD_USER_ID`. Injects a `Discord mentions resolved:` block; adds an explicit warning when this agent was addressed.

### Lifecycle + system

- **`inject_time.py`** (UserPromptSubmit) — injects a one-line wall-clock stamp on every prompt. Compensates for stale `currentDate` in long-running sessions.
- **`notify_hook.py`** (Notification) — mirrors Claude Code system notifications (permission prompts, elicitation dialogs) to Discord. Target channel via `NOTIFY_CHANNEL_ID` env, else the most recent Discord-origin chat. Best-effort drops a 🔔 reaction via `react_hook --mode notified`.

### Env vars (per-hook overrides)

All log + state paths default under `~/.local/state/multiagent-tools/`. Override individually:

| Var | Hook | What |
|---|---|---|
| `MAT_REACT_HOOK_LOG` / `MAT_REACT_HOOK_STATE` | react_hook | log + state paths |
| `MAT_NARRATE_LOG` / `MAT_NARRATE_STATE` | narrate | log + state paths |
| `MAT_TOOL_WATCHER_LOG` | tool_watcher | log path |
| `MAT_ECHO_GUARD_LOG` | discord_echo_guard | log path |
| `MAT_PAGINATE_GUARD_LOG` / `MAT_PAGINATE_GUARD_LIMIT` | paginate_guard | log path + char limit (default 1900) |
| `MAT_SCRUB_TAGS_LOG` | scrub_tags | log path |
| `MAT_NOTIFY_HOOK_LOG` | notify_hook | log path |
| `MAT_STOP_HOOK_LOG` | react_hook (memorized mode) | stop-hook log path to scan for 💾 trigger |
| `MAT_REACT_HOOK_BIN` | notify_hook | path to react_hook entrypoint for `--mode notified` |
| `MAT_DISCORD_ROSTER` | discord_mention_resolver | path to user_id → name JSON |
| `MAT_BOT_DISCORD_USER_ID` | discord_mention_resolver | running agent's own Discord user_id |
| `DISCORD_STATE_DIR` | several | per-agent Discord plugin state dir override |

### Legacy save-intent gate

The Stop hook only fires tag handlers when one of the user's last 5 messages contains a save-intent verb (`remember`, `save`, `memory`, `forget`, `delete`, `remove`, `nuke`, `edit`, `note`, `remind`, `journal`, `pin`, `stash`, `memo`). The 5-message window catches multi-turn save flows — e.g. user says "save our address" in turn N, replies with the actual address in turn N+1, assistant emits `[MEMORY:]` in response to N+1 — without it, the gate would scan only the address-only message and silently block.

This prevents meta-discussion of the tag syntax from triggering real writes. To talk *about* the tags without firing them, use the `[MEMORY-EXAMPLE: ...]` / `[JOURNAL-EXAMPLE: ...]` form — those get stripped before scanning.

### Discord cards

When an explicit CLI/API save includes Discord IDs, the app posts a rendered confirmation card to the same channel as a reply:

```
💾 Memory #42 saved
type: feedback · name: Communication style · tags: comm, voice · about: user

Body text in italics, truncated past 600 chars.
Multi-paragraph bodies render naturally with blank lines between.
```

Cards cover save (`💾`), edit (`✏️`), and delete (`🗑️`) for both memory and journal. The hook reads `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` from `MULTIAGENT_DISCORD_TOKEN` first, then falls back to `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_STATE_DIR/.env` and `~/.claude/channels/discord/.env` so the same setup as the rest of your Discord integration works without extra config.

If no Discord origin is in the user message (e.g. the save happened in a terminal session), no card is posted — the CLI's own `Saved #N` output is the confirmation in that case.

## Discord bot

`discord_handler.py` is an optional standalone bot exposing `/mem` and
`/journal` slash commands. To set up:

1. Create a Discord application + bot at <https://discord.com/developers/applications>.
2. Under **OAuth2 → URL Generator**, select scopes `bot` and `applications.commands`. The bot only needs the **default** intents — no Message Content Intent required.
3. Invite the bot to your server with the generated URL.
4. Set `MULTIAGENT_DISCORD_TOKEN=<token>` in `~/.config/multiagent-tools/env`.
5. Optionally set `MULTIAGENT_GUILD_IDS=<csv of guild IDs>` for instant slash-command sync (otherwise it's ~1hr global propagation).
6. Run `python3 discord_handler.py` (or enable the systemd unit installed by `install.sh`).

## Tests

```bash
pip install pytest
pytest tests/
```

Tests are fully isolated from your real data dir (`MULTIAGENT_DATA_DIR` is
set to a `tmp_path` in `conftest.py`) and do not touch the network.

## Inventory probes

The `/inventory` page uses a transport abstraction to read hook chains, crontab, and service lists from each host. Out of the box:

- `LocalTransport` — runs commands directly on the same host as the server.
- Custom transports — drop a class with `run(cmd, timeout) → (rc, stdout, stderr)` into `inventory.py` to reach other hosts. Common patterns: SSH-with-restricted-`command=` wrapper, `kubectl exec`, `docker exec`.

Source of truth (`settings.json`, `crontab`, `systemd` units) stays in its canonical location. This module just reads.
